solbuild.conf(5) -- solbuild configuration
==========================================

## NAME

    solbuild.conf - configuration for solbuild
    
## SYNOPSIS

    /usr/share/solbuild/*.conf
    
    /etc/solbuild/*.conf


## DESCRIPTION

`solbuild(1)` uses configuration files from the above mentioned directories to
configure various aspects of the `solbuild` defaults.

All configuration files must be valid prior to `solbuild(1)` launching, as it
will load and validate them all into a merged configuration. Using a layered
approach, `solbuild` will first read from the global vendor directory,
`/usr/share/solbuild`, before finally loading from the system directory,
`/etc/solbuild`.

`solbuild(1)` is capable of running without configuration, and this method
permits a stateless implementation whereby vendor & system administrator
configurations are respected in the correct order.

## CONFIGURATION FORMAT

`solbuild` uses the `TOML` configuration format for all of it's own
configuration files. This is a strongly typed configuration format, whereby
strict validation occurs against expected key types.

 * `default_profile`

    Set the default profile used by `solbuild(1)`. This must have a string value,
    and will be used by `solbuild(1)` in the absence of the `-p`,`--profile`
    flag.

 * `enable_tmpfs`

    Instruct `solbuild(1)` to use tmpfs mounts by default for all builds. Note
    that even if this is disabled, as it is by default, you may still override
    this at runtime with the `-t`,`--tmpfs` flag.

 * `tmpfs_size`

    Set the default tmpfs size used by `solbuild(1)` when tmpfs builds are
    enabled. An empty value, the default, will mean an unbounded size to
    the tmpfs. This value should be a string value, with the same syntax
    that one would pass to `mount(8)`.

 * `overlay_root_dir`

    Set a custom root directory for all overlay contents used by `solbuild(1)`
    to reside in. This option, allows for the overlay content to be placed anywhere
    which is writable by the user, such as a secondary drive. If this is not set
    the default path `/var/cache/solbuild` will be used as the custom root directory.

    See `solbuild(1)` for more details on the `-t`,`--tmpfs` option behaviour.


## EXAMPLE

    # Set the default profile, a string value assignment
    default_profile = "main-x86_64"

    # Set tmpfs enabled by default, a boolean value assignment
    enable_tmpfs = true
